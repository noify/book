# 简单句
## 句子三原则
* 句子的结束标志: . ! ? ... 
* 句子最基本的单位: 主谓
* 一个简单句只有一套主谓结构
# 并列句
and/but/or
not(only)...but(also)
either...or
# 复合句/三大从句
that/what/where/when/why/how
because/if/whether/as soon as/no matter what...
# 分析长难句步骤
1. 先找标点“. ? ! ...”，确定这是个完整的句子 I like you because you are an angel.
1. 找主谓（山楂）
1. 找连接词（串山楂的串），划分句子
1. 根据从句在整个句子里充当的成分确定是什么从句。记得要运用“蹲坑原理”

## 标点冷知识
*  ; 相当于 , and
* 单—— 相当于 :
* 双——xxx—— 相当于
*  , , 相当于 ()

## 找主语
* 反向: 找谓语前相对独立的名称
* 正向：介短或从句先不看
